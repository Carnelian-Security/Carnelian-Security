# Carnelian Security

The purpose of Carnelian Security is to take novel (or old) PoC code, clean it up, and provide a proper exploit for a given vulnerability as opposed to a sloppy PoC. Exploits will have plug-and-play options similar to Metasploit modules. 

Exploit code from this account is primarly written in python3 and tested from a Linux platform.
